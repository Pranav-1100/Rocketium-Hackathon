# Contributing to Creative Ops Automation Tool

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Creative Ops Automation Tool as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Development Process

We use Github Flow, so all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/Node.js

- Use ES6+ features when possible
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment your code when necessary
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include integration tests when necessary
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Reporting Bugs

### Security Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [security@yourdomain.com] instead.

### Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?

5. What did you see instead?

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! Before submitting a feature request:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Consider if the feature is within scope of the project
3. Provide as much detail and context as possible

## Documentation

- Keep documentation up to date
- Document all new features
- Use clear and concise language
- Include code examples when relevant
